## About 
I recently graduated UC Berkeley with honors degrees in EECS and Applied
Mathematics. I am interested in Bayesian machine learning, probabilistic
programming, and their applications to natural language processing. Currently,
I am a visiting undergraduate researcher at
[MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](https://probcomp.csail.mit.edu). Here,
you can find my [CV](cv.pdf), [transcript](transcript.pdf), and [LinkedIn
Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mghavami/). You can contact me at
